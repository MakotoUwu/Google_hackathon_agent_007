**Blocker:** None currently, waiting for build to complete

### Demo Preparation
**Status:** Documentation ready, waiting for live URL
**Next:** Test demo flow once deployed

- [ ] Integrate Google Directions API
- [ ] Allow selecting multiple places from results
- [ ] Calculate accessible routes between places
- [ ] Display route on map with polylines
- [ ] Show turn-by-turn directions with accessibility notes

**Priority:** LOW - Can be mentioned as "future feature"

### Enhanced Place Information (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Show detailed accessibility features for each place
- [ ] Display photos with accessibility highlights
- [ ] Show user reviews mentioning accessibility
- [ ] Rate places by accessibility score
- [ ] Show nearby accessible parking/restrooms

**Priority:** LOW - Current info is sufficient for demo

### Personalization & History (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Save favorite accessible places to database
- [ ] Store search history
- [ ] Remember user's accessibility preferences
- [ ] Quick access to recently searched places
- [ ] Share accessible routes with others

---

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### Non-Critical (Can mention in Q&A)
- [ ] Geocoding shows markers scattered globally instead of locally
  - **Root cause:** Google Geocoding API needs better address formatting
  - **Workaround:** Use Place Details API to get coordinates from place_id
  - **Impact:** LOW - doesn't affect core functionality
  - **Fix time:** 1-2 hours

- [ ] Old error logs in console (can be ignored)
  - **Root cause:** Previous failed agent calls
  - **Impact:** NONE - doesn't affect functionality
  - **Fix time:** 5 minutes (clear logs)

### Critical (Must fix before demo)
- None currently! üéâ
