## üéØ Problem Statement

**People with mobility challenges face daily obstacles:**
- Finding wheelchair-accessible places is difficult
- No easy way to verify accessibility features
- Route planning doesn't consider accessibility needs
- Information is scattered across multiple sources

**Our Solution:** An AI-powered assistant that makes accessibility information instantly accessible through natural conversation.

## üí° Solution Overview

**Maps Agent** is an intelligent accessibility assistant powered by Google ADK that:

‚úÖ **Understands natural language** - Ask in plain English  
‚úÖ **Finds accessible places** - Real-time data from Google Maps  
‚úÖ **Provides detailed info** - Entrance, restroom, seating, parking accessibility  
‚úÖ **Plans routes** - Considers accessibility throughout the journey  
‚úÖ **Voice-enabled** - Hands-free interaction with Gemini Live API

## üîß Technical Highlights

### Google ADK Integration

**Agent Definition:**
```python
agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    tools=[google_maps_grounding],
    system_instruction="""
    You are an accessibility-focused maps assistant.
    Help users find wheelchair-accessible places with 
    detailed accessibility information.
    """
)
```

**Tool Configuration:**
```python
google_maps_grounding = GoogleMapsGroundingTool(
    google_search_retrieval=GoogleSearchRetrieval(
        dynamic_retrieval_config=DynamicRetrievalConfig(
            mode=Mode.MODE_DYNAMIC,
            dynamic_threshold=0.7
        )
    )
)
```

## üé§ Q&A

**Common Questions:**

**Q: How accurate is the accessibility information?**  
A: Data comes directly from Google Maps, which aggregates information from businesses, users, and Google's own verification processes.

**Q: Can this work in other cities/countries?**  
A: Yes! google_maps_grounding works globally wherever Google Maps has data.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**  
A: Cloud Run free tier covers ~10K requests/month. Gemini API costs ~$0.50-2 per 1M tokens. Maps API has 28K free map loads/month.

**Q: Is the code open source?**  
A: The project is available for review and can be open-sourced after the hackathon.

**Q: Can I add my own accessibility reviews?**  
A: This feature is planned! Users will be able to contribute verified accessibility information.
