# Google ADK Best Practices

## Tutorials Overview
ADK provides progressive, step-by-step guides for building agents:

### 1. Multi-tool agent
- Create workflows that use multiple tools
- Foundation for building sophisticated agents
- **Our current implementation** ✓

### 2. Agent team
- Build multi-agent workflows with agent delegation
- Session management
- Safety callbacks
- **Next level improvement**

### 3. Streaming agent
- Handle streamed content for real-time responses
- Better UX with progressive output

## Key Areas to Explore

### Advanced Features
1. **Agent Teams** - Multiple specialized agents working together
2. **Callbacks** - Types of callbacks and patterns
3. **Memory** - Session state and Vertex AI Extensions
4. **Observability** - Logging, Cloud Trace, AgentOps
5. **Evaluation** - Testing and criteria
6. **Deployment** - Agent Engine, Cloud Run, GKE

### Tools
1. **Built-in tools** - Google Search, Maps Grounding
2. **Gemini API tools** - Computer use
3. **Google Cloud tools** - Code Execution, Extensions
4. **Custom Tools** - Function tools with performance optimization

### Production Considerations
1. **Safety and Security**
2. **Grounding** - Understanding Google Search Grounding
3. **A2A Protocol** - Agent-to-Agent communication
4. **Bidi-streaming (live)** - Real-time audio/video

## Current Implementation Status
✅ Multi-tool agent with google_maps_grounding
✅ Vertex AI integration
✅ Accessibility-focused prompts
✅ ADK web server for testing

## Next Steps for Improvement
1. Add streaming for better UX
2. Implement callbacks for safety
3. Add memory/session state
4. Deploy to Cloud Run/Agent Engine
5. Add observability (logging, tracing)
